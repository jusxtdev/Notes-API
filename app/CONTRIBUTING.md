# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this small Notes API project. This file contains a short, lightweight set of steps to get changes submitted.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

2. Make your changes. Keep them small and focused.

3. Run and add tests where appropriate. There is no test suite in this repo yet; include tests if you add functionality.

4. Commit and push, then open a Pull Request (PR) describing the change and rationale.

Notes:
- Follow existing code style and keep changes backwards-compatible where possible.
- If you add third-party dependencies, update the README with install instructions.

If you're unsure where to start, open an issue describing the change you want to make.
